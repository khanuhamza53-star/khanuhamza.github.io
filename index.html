    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Indigo & Neutral -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: Designed a vertical-scrolling SPA with 5 key sections to transform the linear speech into an engaging recruitment tool. 1) Hero with name/tagline. 2) Interactive 3-tab section for "What We Do" (Photography, Film, Digital) to make service discovery active. 3) 3-column card grid for "The Next Gen Advantage" (Portfolio, Skills, Networking) to visually emphasize benefits. 4) A "Mission" block. 5) A "Welcome" section for new members. This structure guides the user from awareness (Hero) to exploration (Tabs), persuasion (Benefit Cards), and inclusion (Welcome), which is more effective for recruitment than a plain text page. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Source speech is qualitative. No quantitative data is present, so no charts (Chart.js/Plotly.js) are used. 1) Services (What We Do) -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Interactive Tabs (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Click-to-reveal text -> Justification: Breaks up dense text, encourages exploration. 2) Benefits (Why Join?) -> Goal: Inform/Compare -> Viz: 3-Column Card Grid (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: None (static layout) -> Justification: Easy to scan, gives equal weight to each benefit. All other content is presented as styled text blocks. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
